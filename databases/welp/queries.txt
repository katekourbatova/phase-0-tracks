You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT reviews.*, businesses.*, users.* FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
