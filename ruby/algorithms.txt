Algorithm for using elevator

- decide which floor you are going to.
- check which floor you are currently on by looking for a number near the elevator.
- if there is no number near the elevator, ask a human what floor you are on.
  - if the floor you are currently on is a smaller number than the floor you are going to:
    - press the up button near the elevator door
  - if the floor you are currently on is a larger number than the floor you are going to:
    - press the down button near the elevator door
  - if you are already on the floor you want to go to, you don't need to use the elevator.
- when the elevator arrives and the door opens, go inside the elevator.
- press the button with the number of the floor you are going to.
- when the elevator stops, check if the number it is displaying is equal to the number of the floor you are going to.
  - if the numbers are equal, leave the elevator
  - if the numbers are not equal, stay in the elevator and repeat until they are equal.
