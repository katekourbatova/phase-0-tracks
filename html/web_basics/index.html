	<title>How to: Plant Propagation</title>

	<h1>How do I make more plants out of less plants?</h1>

	<p>If you are a gardener or hiker or like eating food, you may have wondered -- how do I make <em>more</em> plants out of the plants that are already there? For most plants, your choices are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Collect seeds and grow plants from seed</li>
		<li>Take cuttings of plants and hope that they will root (possibly with the help of rooting hormone)</li>
	</ul>
  <p>And then there are things like <a href="http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ferns/Sci-Media/Animations-and-Interactives/Fern-life-cycle">ferns</a> and <a href="http://lifeofplant.blogspot.com/2011/03/lichens.html">lichens</a>. But they're <strong>weird</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Berries you should propagate</h2>
  <p>If your life's ambition goes something like "Eat berries. <strong>For science!</strong>" -- then you've come to the right place. Here are some of the native Pacific Northwest berries (of varying deliciousness) that you can propagate.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Salmonberry</em> - kind of like blackberries, but yellow and less sweet.</li>
    <li><em>Red huckleberry</em> -- makes the best mid-summer ice cream!</li>
    <li><em>Thimbleberry</em> -- cute and fuzzy, and delicious, but doesn't keep. Also, the leaves are super soft and remind you of kittens, as in you will want to pet them. (Is it just me?)</li>
    <li><em>Trailing blackberry</em> -- not to be confused with the ubiquitous Himalayan blackberry.</li>
    <li><em>Oregon grape</em> -- extremely sour, but also surprisingly enjoyable. Especially if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synsepalum_dulcificum">miracle fruit</a> is also involved.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Go forth and conquer!</p>
