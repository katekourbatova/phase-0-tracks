<!-- Release 4: Reflect
 The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to make the web more accessible (important for people with screenreaders) and to make code more readable and consistent for different developers.

 I see <nav> as the most useful, as it makes it easy for screenreaders to skip navigation links, and it's handy as a CSS selector, since you'll likely want to style your <nav> section differently than the rest of the page. <main> is also great for screenreaders, a lot of them have an option for skipping to main content.

 The browser displays elements in the order they are listed, unless they are rearranged with CSS.

 I learned how to make snippets. I think I'll make myself a table snippet to save time, and maybe a form snippet.

 Nothing in this challenge was particularly difficult, but it was great review.
